## Wifi-locationing (IoT analytics) - Project Description


**Project Goal:** investigate the feasibility of using "wifi fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces by evaluating multiple machine learning models.

**Data characteristics:** we have been provided by a large database of wifi fingerprints for a multi-building industrial campus with a location (building, floor, and location ID) associated with each fingerprint. We need to use the signal intensity recorded from multiple wifi hotspots within the building to determine the person's location.


## Technical Analysis
**Language used:** R programming
